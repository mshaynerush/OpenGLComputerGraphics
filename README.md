How do I approach designing software?
I look at the specification and what is the overall goal of the application. Then I break it down into tasks and code one task at a time. After I get the major methods and minimal functionality, I modularize where possible and add better functionality. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I definitely learned how to write coordinates and to visualize things in 3D though I am not a visual person.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I decided what the broader shapes I would need to create the objects in my scene, then I focused on the position. After I got the objects located where they should go, I went for texture and lighting.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I am not sure I am cut out for design and graphics, but at lease now I won't be afraid of it.

How do I approach developing programs?
I develope a method and test it. Once that method is working, I focus on the next method. That's pretty much the gist.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Not so much strategy, but I had to alter my entire schedule. In this class, I struggled to get my project going, and by the time I did, I was way behind. In the end, I produced something I'm somewhat proud of, but I knew it would be late, so I decided not to turn in something for a lower score, and try to hit all of the requirements and maximize my final grade. If I had turned the project in in on time, I likely would have recieve an 80% so by turning it in late, I eanred an extra 10% which i think was a good strtegy in this case. Plus, it paid off in the fact that the project is pretty cool as is.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was everything. Once I was able to make a cube, I turned my attention to texture. After i got that down, I just needed to learn how to make mulitiple objects. That took awhile. Once I did that, it was all downhill from there.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Well, in this case, I was so strapped fro time that I didn't have time to iterate the final step of abstracting away the drawing methods. But I essentially went for learning how to connect vertices, then how to position texture so that it looked correct on the triangles, then apply that logic to the cylinders and spheres

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I have long wanted to be an application developer. This is my goal. Surprisingly, other non computer science related topics have helped round out my education as well, so the entire program so far has been evelating in every way.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I sincerely hope I never have to do anything graphic heavy in my career. I have never been a visual artist, and I don't see being able to draw triangles helpful, but I did enjoy the experience for learning how to think about things a little differently.
